# 1.0.19 / 2017-02-03

  + Fixed PyPI package name.


## 1.0.18 / 2017-02-03

  + Added Sphinx auto-documentation. So far it's only hosted locally. Sorry
    everyone! I plan to put it on ReadTheDocs soon.
  + Cleaned up imports 'cause they were crap.
  + Monkeypatched `wx.Colour`. Now you don't have to muck with your wxPython
    installation, yay!
  + Fixed Appveyor CI.


## 1.0.17 / 2016-04-11

  + Fixed bug in toggle_die_gridlines()


## 1.0.16 / 2016-04-11

  + Fixed imports for Py3


## 1.0.15 / 2016-04-11

  + Version bump because of a messed up PyPI release.


## 1.0.14 / 2016-04-11

  + Added option to display die gridlines.


## 1.0.11 / 2015-10-28

  + Implemented #31 - added radius of die and mouse to status bar.


## 1.0.10 / 2015-05-04

  + Playing around with imports. Trying to make it so that if I'm running
    a file from my development directory, it imports all the development
    modules and if I'm running something else, it imports from the
    released (site-packages) directory.
  + Fixed Issue #30


## 1.0.9 / 2015-05-04

  + Fixed flicker issue.


## 1.0.8 / 2015-05-04

  + I messed up on the PyPI release, so I have to release under a new file
    name. Oh well...


## 1.0.7 / 2015-05-04

  + Minor import refactoring
  + Added some docstrings


## 1.0.6 / 2015-04-01

  + Refactored wm_core.draw_wafer_outline so that there are fewer branches
  + Added wm_core.calc_flat_coords to reduce code duplication. This function
    calculates the start and end coordinates of a horizontal chord below
    the circle origin whos length spans a given angle. See doctring on
    wm_core.calc_flat_coords for more info.
  + Fixed issue where a flat exclusion of 0 would not work
  + Fixed issue where an exclusion of 0 would prevent the flat exclusion from
    being drawn.


## 1.0.5 / 2015-03-30

  + Added optional "grid_center" input to gen_fake_data
  + Fixed Issue #28: Updated wm_utils.linear_gradient to act on HSL data
    rather than on RGB data.
  + Updated documentation for items in wm_utils.
  + Added option to plot the die centers as small red dots.
  + Added option to have the wafer map use a constant number of items for
    discrete legend.


## 1.0.4 / 2014-12-29

  + Changed import statements to not be weird.


## 1.0.3 / 2014-12-17

  + Fixed Issue #9: Users can now change the high and low colors for
    continuous data by passing in arguements or by using the app menu:
    ``Options --> Set High Color`` or ``Set Low Color``
  + Fixed Issue #26
  + Fixed Issue #25: Continuous data now generates colors from a single
    algorithm.
  + Fixed Issue #14: Discrete Data now uses an acceptable algorithm for
    determining colors.
  + Fixed Issue #16: The plot now zooms to fit upon first draw. However,
    this created issue #21.
  + Started to add unit tests
  + Updated fake data generator to accept parameter inputs. Any missing
    parameter is randomly generated.
  + The legend for continuous data now fills the entire available vertical
    area.
  + Added a color for invalid data points such as NaN or Inf.
  + Plot range can now be set manually. If it's not set, then it uses the
    2nd and 98th percentiles.
  + Added yellow circle representing the wafer as if the flat did not exist.
  + Created wm_constants.py to contain various default values such as colors.
  + Some other changes that I can't remember and foolishly didn't write
    down.


## 1.0.0 / 2014-12-05

  + Official release.
  + The Legend should now work as intended.


## 0.6.0 / 2014-12-04

  + Closed issues #1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 in the tracker.
  + Updated gen_fake_data to use better algorithm and actually output
    correct data.
  + Updated wm_core.WaferMapPanel so that the status bar text displays
    the correct grid values. Verified working with all sorts of
    grid_center values.
  + **Last Update before release, yay!** All that's left is to get the
    legend working.


## 0.5.0 / 2014-12-02

  + renamed wafer_map.py to wm_core.py.
  + Finally figured out the imports for running in development from my
    own dev directory vs running in "production" from the site-packages
    directory.


## 0.4.0 / 2014-12-02

  + Massive change to package hierarchy - separated app, frame, info, and fake
    data into individual modules.


## 0.3.0 / 2014-12-01

  + Added kb shortcuts and menu items for display toggle
    of wafer outline and crosshairs.
  + Added placeholder for legend and kb shortcut for display toggle.
  + Added option for plotting discrete data.


## 0.2.0 / 2014-11-26

  + Made it so a wafer map can be plotted with a single
    command.
  + Updated example.py to demo single-command usage.


## 0.1.0 / 2014-11-25

  + First working code. Added example file.


## 0.0.1 / 2014-11-25

  + Project Creation
